### Goal
When developer a api, you need to do more easily ways to take expressive params on url,
like pagination, fields (selectable), conditions, ordering, limitations...

To help some dev's (me :) ) i decide make this lib with agnostic framework, although i use cakephp, this lib
intent to any framework like simple use traits and define commons abstraction functions on you repository.


### Installation
````bash
composer require marcos/express-param
